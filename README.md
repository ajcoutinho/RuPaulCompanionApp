# RuPaulCompanionApp

An App desinged for RuPaul's Drag Race fans, for use while watching the show. Available for Apple products.

## Features


### Encycl-Ru-Pedia

An API-powered lookup of past episodes, and the contestants that participated. Users can look up  
episodes by their season, then see the details of the episode, including who participated in  
that episode.

This is powered by No Key No Shade. You can see their documentation here: <https://drag-race-api.readme.io/docs>

**Note:** The API that powers this function is no longer in service.

### Toot or Boot

A way to interact with the show. Users can take a picture of their TVs during the "Runway" portion of the show,  
and then slide the image left or right to like ("Toot") or dislike ("Boot") the subject's look. Also supports  
images from the user's Photo Library. The Toot or Boot section is not limited to use during the show; use it
anywhere to save something that you like or dislike!

### Gallery

A collection of images that you've saved through the Toot or Boot feature. Users can reminisce of past looks,
change their opinion of them, or add more information about each of them.
